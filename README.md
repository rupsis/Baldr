// Important things:

discriminant in the quadratic equation (sphere intersection).
if negative, no intersection. if positive, there are 2 solution (where the ray enters, and exists). If zero, it touches the edge of the sphere.

Barycentric coordinates

Cramer's rule (fastest way to solve 3x3 linear system)
